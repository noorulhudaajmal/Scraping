## Project Scripts

### DPscrap.py
This script utilizes Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape the display pictures of LinkedIn profiles. It requires the Chrome WebDriver and downloads the images into the "Images" directory. The script prompts for LinkedIn login credentials and allows you to enter profile URLs to scrape the display pictures.

### Scraper.py
This script utilizes the linkedin_api library to extract public profile information, with a focus on work experience. It prompts for LinkedIn credentials and allows you to search for profiles either by username or URL. The script displays the user's name, current company, and duration of their work experience.

### scraper.py
This script is a variation of the Scraper.py script mentioned above. It also utilizes the linkedin_api library to extract public profile information, specifically work experience. The script prompts for LinkedIn credentials and allows you to search for profiles either by username or URL. It displays the user's name, current company, and duration of their work experience.

### work_exp_Scrapee.py
This script uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape work experience information from LinkedIn profiles. Similar to the other scripts, it prompts for LinkedIn login credentials and allows you to enter profile URLs to extract the work experience details.
